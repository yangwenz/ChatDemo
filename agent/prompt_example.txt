Question: How does a broadcast work?
Answer: For a typical broadcast, speakers are hosted on Zoom and viewers watch on IBM Watson. Using our production equipment, we connect the 2 together. As part of our PLUS package, we can manipulate how the stream looks.
Question: Where can I watch the stream?
Answer: You can watch all streams on the IBM Watson platform. There are specific channels that each event can stream on. All event hosts will be emailed the specific channel link to send attendees.
Question: Can the audience watch on Zoom?
Answer: The IBM channel is designated for live viewership while Zoom is reserved for presenters, organizers, and stream operators. If your event requires the audience to watch on Zoom (usually external events), you can work with your Streamforce operator to set this up as part of the PLUS package.
Question: Can you stream to social media channels?
Answer: Yes - Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn (any platform that can support RTMP)
Question: How can I book caption services?
Answer: Caption service is booked on behalf of the organizer by a Streamforce team member/event operator

Answer: As part of the PLUS package, the Streamforce member can play videos at any time during your event. Please deliver the videos at least 2 days before the event. If you are using our Standard package and want to play a video, the event operator will work with you on the best way to share a video.

Answer: As part of our PLUS package, we can add graphics, overlays, and lower thirds. These graphics will need to be provided to us at least 2 days before show day.

Question: Do you help me edit (remove) unnecessary parts of my video recording?
Answer: As part of the Streamforce service, we will trim the beginning, end and fix any major errors of your event for the VOD. Streamforce does not edit any pre-recorded content to be played back during the event.
Question: Can I download recorded files and distribute them within my network?
Answer: If you need the recording for any post-event distribution, you can work with your stream operator to deliver a download link to you. Please note that all internal events are confidential and should not be distributed externally without proper authorization.
Question: What camera should I use?
Answer: An external 1080p webcam or DSLR will give you a better picture than the built-in laptop webcam (which is only 720p). You can still use your laptop webcam, we just ask that you raise your laptop so the webcam is level with your eyes.

Question: Can we use breakout rooms for our event?
Answer: Streamforce does not support breakout rooms. If your event requires breakout rooms they will need to be managed by the event host.
Question: How many presenters can I have?
Answer: There is no set limit on the number of presenters for your event. Please work with your Streamforce team member to develop the best plan based on the number of presenters.
Question: Can you create a custom gallery view?
Answer: Custom gallery views can be used for a certain number of presenters. Based on your event, the default gallery in Zoom might be the best solution. Work with your Streamforce team member for more details.
Question: Is there any cost associated with Streamforce?
Answer: Streamforce is an internal team that comes at no cost.
Question: Why does the stream look blurry or pixelated on IBM Watson?
Answer: This is usually due to the viewer not selecting the “HD” button that can be found in the bottom right of the video player. We recommend watching in 1080P or 720P
